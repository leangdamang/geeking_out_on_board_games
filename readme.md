This is my second project for Metis, focusing on machine learning for board game analysis. I scraped over 6k board game reviews from BoardGameGeek.com using Selenium and Scrapy and gathered data like complexity (0-5), game mechanics, price - both retail and ebay, and year. 

This was prior to learning how to do NLP, and I'd expand out this project to include review analysis as well to see what topics good vs bad games cluster around.
